# Monetary-Economics

This is my attempt at building the stock-flow consistent models in "Monetary Economics: An Integrated Approach to Credit, Money, Income, Production and Wealth" by Wynne Godley and Marc Lavoie

The only complete model in the repository initially is Model DIS, from Chapter 9. Model DIS_INF is also included but it would need some work to be complete. I'm working currently on Model INSOUT and will add that once complete. The goal is to eventually build Model GROWTH, and a GUI that is useful in interacting with it. Once the core of the model is built, I plan to make some changes and customizations to make it more realistic.

I will eventually add comments to make the code more understandable. If you're working through the book and have any questions, let me know and I'd be happy to do what I can to help. sfc-models.net is also a great resource if you need more help. 

If you're wondering what sort of math is useful in building these models, Linear Algebra is most useful earlier in the book. Specifically Guassian Reduction. The later chapters (so far at least) are solvable with just standard algebra, but the equations need to be solved in the correct order.
